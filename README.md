# A collection of the sports activity (tcx) test files for benchmarking the parsers

This is a **.tcx** sample collection of different sports activities files. The current samples cover **cycling**, **swimming**, **walking**, **running**, and **sup**.

It can serve as a sample for developing sports activities record:
- reader / parser,
- visualizer,
- editor.

For data science solutions more sports activities files are found in the link provided in the references.

We encourage you to use our solution [sport-activities-features](https://github.com/firefly-cpp/sport-activities-features) (Python) for working with **.tcx** files. We also developed a [tcx reader](https://github.com/alenrajsp/tcxreader) (Python).

## What are .tcx files?

[TCX](https://fileinfo.com/extension/tcx) is a file extension used for sports sessions records developed by [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/). The sports sessions are recorded by Garmin wearable devices (e.g. smartwatch) and are in a XML format.
